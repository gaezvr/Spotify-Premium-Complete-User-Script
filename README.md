What Are UserScripts ?

A user script extension is a software program that allows users to customize the functionality of their web browser. User scripts are typically written in JavaScript and can modify the appearance or behavior of a web page. User script extensions provide a way for users to easily install and manage these scripts, often with a single click.

Popular user script extensions include Greasemonkey for Firefox and Tampermonkey for Chrome, both of which allow users to install and manage user scripts. Once installed, user scripts can do a wide variety of things, such as removing annoying ads from web pages, adding new features to social media sites, or enhancing the usability of online tools.

While user scripts can be incredibly powerful and useful, it's important to exercise caution when installing them. Because user scripts have access to the web page's HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, they can potentially be used to steal information or perform malicious actions. Users should only install user scripts from trusted sources and be careful when granting them access to sensitive information.
